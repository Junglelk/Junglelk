# 🧠 Interests

- Distributed systems and performance tuning

- JVM internals and code-level optimization

- Clean architecture (DDD, MVC) and maintainable design

- Writing developer tools with simple, elegant UIs (JavaFX, no FXML)

# ⚡ Fun fact

- I value clarity and precision over buzzwords.
- If something can’t be measured or tested, it’s probably not “optimized” yet.
